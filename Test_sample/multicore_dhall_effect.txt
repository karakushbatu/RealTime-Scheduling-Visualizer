# Dhall's Effect Simulation (Use with 2 Cores)
# Demonstrates Global RM failure even at low utilization.
# T1 & T2 are light but high freq. T3 is heavy but low freq.

# T1: High Priority (Short Period)
P 0 2 10 10
# T2: High Priority (Short Period)
P 0 2 10 10

# T3: Low Priority (Long Period) but HEAVY execution
# Global RM might schedule T1 & T2 on both cores, leaving T3 late.
